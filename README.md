Tiny crate providing added functionality to the futures-rs threadpool executor.
The `futures::future::ThreadPool` executor currently has no way built in to handle panics, manually stop the pool execution or bubble up errors back to the caller.
The crate works around these limitations (it might get obsolete once [this open issue will be resolved](https://github.com/rust-lang/futures-rs/issues/1468)).

Use cases for the crate are:
* Stop executing futures in case any of future that runs on it faces an unrecoverable error and returns an Err().
* Let the caller handle the error.
* Stop the threadpool and its spawned tasks on user request.

âš  This crate is beeing passively maintained. It works just fine for me in an existing project. However I'll be using [smol](https://crates.io/crates/smol) as my futures executor in new projects. The `smol` task handles offer the same functionality (and more), rendering this crate obsolete.

# Usage

The following example demonstrates the handling of a failing task:
```rust
async fn forever() -> Result<(),String> {
    loop {}
}

async fn fail(msg: String) -> Result<(),String> {
    Err(msg)
}

let mut pool = StoppableThreadPool::new()?;
let err = "fail_function_called".to_string();
pool.spawn(fail(err.clone()));
pool.spawn(forever());

assert_eq!(
    pool.observe().await.unwrap_err(),
    err
)
```

Have a look at the tests in [lib.rs](https://github.com/xermicus/poolparty/blob/master/src/lib.rs#L114) for more usage examples.
